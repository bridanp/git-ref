<h4>Workspace - checkouts on local workstations</h4>

git status
Shows the files or paths that have differences between the current commit and the index file, between the workspace as a whole and the index, or any path in the workspace that isn't be tracked by git.</p>


git diff [<commit>/<branch>]
Shows the differences not currently in the index.  Add a specific commit or branch if the comparison should be specific.</p>

git diff --cached [<commit>]
Displays changes staged against what has been committed.  Specific <commit> is optional; will use the latest commit if left off.</p>


git add [<file>/<directory>]
Adds the specified files or directories to the index for staging into the next commit.  Can used specific filenames or wildcard with an *.  * or . can be used to add all changed files and directories.</p>


git add -u
Only adds files modified to the staging area.  New files are left out.</p>


git rm <file>
Removes the specific file from both the index and the workspace.</p>


git mv <file>
Moves the specified file in both the index and workspace.

git clean
Removes all files in the current directory tree that are not being tracked.


git commit -a
Commits all files changed since the last commit, and deletes files removed from the workspace.


git checkout [<file/directory>]
Updates the file or directory.

git checkout -- <somefilename>
If unstaging isn't enough, but you want all changes on a file reverted to the last commit, use "checkout".

git reset <somefilename>
If you decide to not commit a change, use this command to unstage a change.

git reset --hard
All files changed since last commit are lost and workspace reverts to the local tree. Recommndations are to only use if a merge has caused an insurmountable conflict.

git reset --hard origin/master
All files changed since last commit on the local repository are lost, and now match the remote/branch.  Origin/master are used here because those are typical names.

git reset HEAD <file>
Removes file typed in from being included in the next commit.  The changes are still available, but not included in the next commit.

git reset --soft HEAD^
Removes the last commit, but the changes are kept.

git checkout <newbranch>
Switch to the new branch.

git checkout -b <newbranch>
Create new branch and switch to it at the same time.

git merge <branch>
Merge your changes from a dev branch into the master or current branch.

git rebase upstream
Reverts all commits from the time the branch diverged.

git cherry-pick <commit>
Installs changes for the selected <commit> into the current branch.

git revert <commit>
Reversese any change made at the selected <commit> and then commits the result.

git clone <repo>
Downloads the specified repo to the local workarea and creates a checkout of the master.  <repo> is typically a remote like https://github.com/<username>/<yourrepo>.git, but it can also be a local repository.

git pull origin master
Pulls code from your "origin" remote, master and pulls changes into the local.  Useful if code in your local repository is not as current as, say, the GitHub code.
